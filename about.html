        <h2><b>Project Information</b></h2>
        <h3><b>Motivations</b></h3> 
        <p> 
            After exploring various datasets and topics we decided to explore homicide trends in the United States between 1980 and 2014.
            We chose this dataset because it had a wide range of variables of different types. The range of this dataset would allow us to 
            create charts of different types. These charts include maps, bar graphs, and area charts. <br><br>
            We wanted to use this data to highlight trends in each state and to identify which weapons were most commonly associated with 
            homocidal deaths. 
        </p>
        <h3><b>Design Rationale for Visual Encoding Decisions and Interaction Techniques</b></h3>
        <p>

            Our interactive website includes the following visualizations and features:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Map: Allows users to analyze homicides per state per year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Area Chart: Allows users to identify homicide trends in a selected state. Users can compare how homicides rise and fall
                    throughout the years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bar Chart: Allows users to identify most common weapons used in homicides per state per year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slider: Allows user to filter the map by year. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interactive tooltip (map): Allows users to explore number of homicides commited in a certain state
                    in the specified year
                </li>
            </ul>

            When designing our final site we wanted to ensure that our visualizations allowed users to explore the data at both a 
            broad level and a granular level. The slider allows users to filter the data and narrow their focus to a single period.
            Interacting with the primary map chart allows users to examine big-picture trends as well as anual trends. For instance, the 
            area chart allows users to view trends over the entire time period documented in our data while the bar chart allows the users 
            to understand the nature of the homicides in more detail. The bar chart allows users to identify an additional layer to the 
            data beyond simple counts. Additionally, colors encoded in the main chart allow users to easily identify which states have 
            the highest homicidal incidence rates. 

        </p>
        <h3><b>Takeaways</b></h3>
        <p>
            Our visualization reveals three primary takeaways:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Homicidal trends vary widely by state
                </li>
                <li>
                    Though weapons used differ per state and year, handguns are often the most commonly used weapon
                </li>
                <li>
                    California, Texas, and New York consistently have the highest number of homicides. However, this is likely
                    connected to population size. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2><b>Design and Development Process</b></h2>
        <h3><b>Original Sketches</b></h3>
        <p>
            We used Tableau to preform preliminary data exploration. Below are some charts we considered in our original data 
            exploration. 
        </p><br>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src="map.png" width="400" height="200" alt="map_pic"> 
                </div>
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src="area.png" width="400" height="200" alt="area_pic"> 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src="bar.png"  width="400" height="200" alt="bar_pic"> 
                </div>
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src="bubble.png" width="400" height="200" alt="bubble_pic"> 
                </div>
            </div> 
        <p>
            The sketches helped us guide our ideas and most of the sketches we created were included in our final webpage. We decided
            to use the bar chart over the bubble chart because we believed it identified more insightful information about the nature
            of the homicides. For instance, understanding which weapons are most deadly and popular among those who commit homicides
            could have policy implications moving forward. 
        </p>
        <h3><b>Challenges</b></h3>
        <p>
            Creating the map was challenging because the original data was not in a json file. Therefore we had to use an external 
            json file to properly project the map and display the data in the final map chart that serves as the central focus of our
            visualization
        </p> 
        <p>
            Connecting and importing each javascript file proved to be a challenge. Since most of the page updates respond to a map 
            click we ended up connecting most files and external functions to the primary map chart rather than the main javascript file.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Aligning titles and formatting our page proved more challenging than expected. Working with multiple graphs and a limited 
            amount of space encouraged us to think aobut the best way to align maps, labels, and axes in order to minimize clutter. 
        </p>
        <h3><b>Lessons Learned</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Practiced coordinating graphs and connecting multiple charts. We are sure these lessons will be helpful for the final
                project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Moving forward it is important to consider how to coordinate/organize files before designing charts and communicate
                this organization with group. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Practiced devising meaningful questions that help users recognize patters and answer questions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Practiced web designing and planning skills. Used external technologies to create data sketches.
            </li>
        </ul>
